## 📄 Abstract & Overview


This toy model investigates the spectral dynamics of high-dimensional correlation systems and numerically demonstrates the emergence of a stable dominant mode in pre-geometric regimes. A combined analysis of the spectrum of the informational metric ($g = -\log \rho$), spectral entropy, and the projected Hessian reveals a robust phenomenon: \textbf{Informational Causal Condensation}.

Computational experiments at scales $N = 512$ and $N = 1024$ show that: (i) the entropy of the collapsed spectrum converges to $S \approx 0$, indicating dimensional complexity collapse; (ii) no geometric subspace emerges spontaneously; (iii) the condensed mode remains stable under infinitesimal perturbations ($H \ge 0$).

These results provide a mathematical description of a \emph{pre-geometric state} in which spatial structure is absent and only a single ordering axis becomes dominant. We propose this informational ordering as a structural precursor to physical time, distinct from the dynamical time dimension of relativistic cosmology. This work establishes a minimal numerical model describing how a purely informational system can exhibit causal dominance without generating geometry.
A critical methodological consideration in this study is the potential criticism regarding the inevitability of dominance. In correlation-based systems with strictly positive entries, the existence of a single dominant eigenvalue (λ1) is algebraically guaranteed by the Perron-Frobenius Theorem.

This raises the risk that the observed Rank-1 dominance might be interpreted not as new physics, but rather as a trivial algebraic artifact inherent to the matrix choice. To address this distinction, we introduce the analysis of the Phase Behavior vs. Correlation Parameter (β). Figure [Phase Behavior] illustrates the system’s dynamic response: instead of exhibiting a static dominance, the system displays a dynamic crossover. We observe a reciprocal evolution: the
dominance ratio (λ1/λ2) remains trivial (≈ 1) in the disordered regime but exhibits exponential growth exactly as the Spectral Entropy collapses from high disorder to zero. This sharp, parameterdependent behavior demonstrates that the condensation is a physical regime driven by correlation intensity, rather than a static property of the matrix. We thus characterize a numerical relationship governing the emergence of order.

This approach also defines the precision of our terminology. The data reveals a continuous trajectory from a high-entropy state to a zero-entropy condensed state, rather than a discontinuous jump. Therefore, we adopt the cautious and robust description of a "phase crossover" or "condensation regime", adjusting our scientific tone to the numerical evidence. This distinction is crucial for rigorously positioning our work within the context of pre-geometric physics. Using large-scale numerical diagonalization of the informational distance matrix g = − log ρ constructed from N = 1024 random points, we identify a remarkably clear crossover — controlled by the inverse correlation length β — from a disordered spectral phase (high entropy) to a fully condensed rank-1 phase. The core finding is that the dominance ratio λ1/λ2 grows exponentially within the same interval where the spectral entropy vanishes (S → 0), confirming the stability of the
emergent order. The spectral analysis demonstrates that this condensed phase possesses only a single ordering axis and actively suppresses the emergence of geometric spatial structure. We conclude that the phenomenon is a non-trivial, parameter-driven precursor to causality in pre-geometric systems.
With these brief comments addressed, let us proceed.

(...) |This plot demonstrates the system’s response to varying the correlation parameter β (log scale). (Blue Curve, Left Axis): The dominance ratio (λ1/λ2) remains low for small β (short-range correlations) but exhibits a sharp, exponential growth as β increases, indicating a transition to a regime where the first mode absorbs effectively all spectral weight. (Red Dashed Line, Right Axis): The spectral entropy S remains at the numerical floor (≈ 10−12), confirming that the condensed state is a robust attractor of the system’s informational dynamics across a wide range of parameters. This confirms that Informational Causal Condensation is a distinct regime driven by the correlation structure, not an artifact of matrix positivity.

## 🧪 Model Core & Key Equations

The model operates on a purely informational substrate defined by the pre-metric $g$, derived from the correlation matrix $\rho$:

$$\rho_{ij} = e^{-D_{ij} / \beta} \qquad \text{and} \qquad g = -\log(\rho + \epsilon)$$

The central operational definition of the pre-geometric phase is:
**Rank-1 Condensation:** The system’s spectral weight concentrates entirely onto the leading eigenvalue ($w_0 \approx 1.0$)[cite: 3753].
**Stability:** The projected Hessian is non-negative ($H_{\text{proj}} \ge 0$)

## 📈 Numerical Results & Evidence

The following figures demonstrate the structural integrity and parameter dependence of the condensation phenomenon (simulated on $N=512$ to $N=1024$ scales):

### 1. Suggestion of Phase Crossover (The $\beta$ Sweep)

This figure is suggestive of, showing the phenomenon is **parameter-dependent**.

| **Figure 10: Phase Behavior ($\lambda_1 / \lambda_2$ vs $\beta$).** The dominance ratio exhibits a sharp, exponential growth as $\beta$ increases, Suggestive of a clear transition from a disordered phase to the Rank-1 condensed phase. |
| ![Spectral weight distribution showing perfect Rank-1](fig_softmax_weights.png) |
The plot of softmax-stabilized weights reveals that the dominant eigenmode (index 0) absorbs the entirety of the informational weight (w ≈ 1.0), while all secondary modes are suppressed to zero. This distribution mathematically corresponds to a vanishing spectral entropy (S = 0),suggesting that the system has stabilized into a single causal axis with no emergent spatial geometry.
| ![Spectral entropy](fig_entropy_zero.png) |
All seeds and system sizes (N = 512, 1024) yield S ≈ 0 within numerical precision. This demonstrates complete condensation of the spectrum into a single mode, marking the system as entering a pre-geometric ordered phase. 


### 2. Spectral Collapse and Robustness

These figures confirm the mathematical signature of the pre-geometric state:

| Figure | Description | Proof Point |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Log-scale Spectrum** | Shows the steep drop-off of the leading mode ($|\lambda_1|$) followed by a continuous tail[cite: 3232]. | **Suggestive of Rank-1.** No secondary spectral plateau/cluster indicating emergent spatial dimensions. |
| **Seed Variability (Boxplot)** | Suggestive of the eigenvalue magnitude and the spectral gaps are highly stable across multiple random initial conditions. | **Suggestive of Robustness.** Not an artifact of a single seed. |
| **Entropy Collapse** |Shows the system's entropy $S$ is at the numerical floor ($\approx 0$) for all runs. | **Suggestive of Maximal Order.** The mathematical signature of complete informational collapse. |
| **Gap Histogram ($\lambda_4/\lambda_5$)** |Shows that the ratio of secondary eigenvalues clusters tightly around $1.03$. | **Rules out $1+3$ Geometry.** No evidence of 3 distinct spatial modes emerging in the spectrum. |

3. For each provided script, **paste it into a new cell and execute only that cell** (do not delete previous cells).
4. Example:
   ```python
