        The eigenvalues $|\lambda(g)|$ form a smooth, monotonically decreasing curve with 
        no identifiable spectral gaps. The absence of clustering or mode separation 
        demonstrates that no geometric substructure (e.g., a $1+3$ block) emerges 
        from the correlation metric. The first mode is mildly larger, but not separated 
        by any robust gap.

    \caption{
        \textbf{Log-scale spectrum of the informational metric $g = -\log\rho$ for $N=512$.}
        The spectrum reveals a clear hierarchy: a single dominant leading mode $|\lambda_1|$ followed by a smooth, monotonically decreasing tail.
        While there is no \emph{geometric} spectral gap (e.g., a cluster of 3 spatial modes), the magnitude of the first mode is sufficiently distinct to drive the system into a condensed phase.
        The absence of secondary plateaus confirms that no spatial substructure emerges, leaving only the primary causal axis.

        \textbf{Spectral weight distribution showing perfect Rank-1 condensation.}
        The plot of softmax-stabilized weights reveals that the dominant eigenmode (index 0) absorbs the entirety of the informational weight ($w \approx 1.0$), while all secondary modes are suppressed to zero. 
        This distribution mathematically corresponds to a vanishing spectral entropy ($S=0$), confirming that the system has stabilized into a single causal axis with no emergent spatial geometry.

        All seeds and system sizes ($N = 512, 1024$) yield $S = 0$ within numerical precision.
        This demonstrates complete condensation of the spectrum into a single mode, 
        marking the system as entering a pre-geometric ordered phase.

        condensed phase as dynamically robust.

        lie along any proto-spatial direction.
